A Brief Description of the Steps Taken to Implement the Design
Figma Analysis:

Carefully analyzed the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and icon styles in the Figma design.

Identified key sections: Navbar, Hero (Home), About, Resume, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

HTML Structure:

Created a clean semantic structure using <header>, <section>, <nav>, <div>, etc.

Added id and class names to match sections for navigation and styling.

CSS Styling:

Designed a custom stylesheet (index.css) to match the Figma design pixel-by-pixel.

Used flexbox and media queries to ensure responsiveness on all devices.

Created reusable classes for buttons, layout, spacing, and icons.

JavaScript Functionality:

Implemented section toggling for "Home" and "About".

Added a dark mode toggle that switches themes and updates icon visibility dynamically.

Image & Icon Integration:

Imported all icons like Facebook, Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc., from the design.

Positioned social media icons in a responsive layout.

Responsiveness:

Used @media queries to ensure mobile/tablet compatibility.

Optimized font sizes, image scale, and layout shifts.

Dark Mode Enhancements:

Applied custom CSS filters (like invert, brightness) to handle PNG icon visibility.

Adjusted background, text, and button colors in dark mode.
